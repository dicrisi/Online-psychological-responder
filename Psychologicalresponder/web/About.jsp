					<h3>A few words about us</h3>
					<h4>Online travel and tourism is a web that gives you facility of booking any type of Tours and Travels packages. This system is made so that Customer will not have to Come to us to Book his\her packages. 
					The project Online travel and tourism is developed to replace the currently existing system, which helps in keeping records of the customer details of destination as well as payment received. In the present where “time” proves to be the most important asset for an individual by replacing the current register system to fully computerize, it not only saves the precious asset that is time, but also accuracy, reliability and uniformity can be maintained. This project is useful for the manager of the company as it helps them to search the data faster than existing system, to get customer record easily and report of the customer, payment, etc are generated as per requirement.
